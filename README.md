1. **Create a `README.md` File**:
   - In your repository folder on your local machine, create a file named `README.md`.
   - Copy and paste the content above into the `README.md` file.

2. **Commit the README File**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to your repository folder.
   - Run the following commands to add, commit, and push the README file:
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Add README file"
     git push origin main
     ```

3. **View the README on GitHub**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub. The README will automatically be displayed on the repository's main page.

By following these steps, you will have a well-documented repository that others can understand and contribute to easily.
